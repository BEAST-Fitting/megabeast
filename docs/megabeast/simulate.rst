Simulations for the MegaBEAST
#############################

To test that the MegaBEAST is behaving as expected, it is important to
simulate data and evaluate if the results match the input.

Simulations should be done with using the BEAST tool to simulate the
fluxes for an ensemble of stars using a BEAST physics+observation model.
Then the BEAST should be used to fit the simulated fluxes and and the
resulting BEAST outputs (especially lnp files) used for testing the MegaBEAST.
