megaBEAST
=========

Hierarchical Bayesian Model of Ensembles of Dust Extinguished Stellar
Populations

The megaBEAST is a hierarchical Bayesian model for ensembles of dust
extinguished stellar populations.
This model uses the results of the
`BEAST (Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool)
<http://beast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
to determine ensemble properties including dust grain properties.
More detail to be added when the megaBEAST development matures.
